## Additional Information

- **File Names**: Each problem has an associated Java file for the solution. For example, `arrayTransformation.java` corresponds to the solution for the 10th problem.
  
- **Test Cases**: For each problem, test cases are provided to help validate the solution and understand the expected behavior. These test cases will allow you to check the correctness of your implementation and ensure that edge cases are handled properly.

- **Implementation Notes**: Some problems may require specific handling, such as boundary conditions or edge cases. These details have been included in the respective test cases, so be sure to review them for a better understanding of how to tackle different situations.

Feel free to refer to the respective Java files for the implementation of each problem. If any problem requires additional clarification or modification, don't hesitate to ask for help.

## Java Programs

The **Java Programs** section contains coding challenges to help you practice core Java concepts, such as loops, arrays, recursion, strings, and more.

Examples of included programs:

- **Swapping Numbers** - Swap two numbers using various methods.
- **FizzBuzz** - Print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
- **Prime Numbers in a Range** - Print prime numbers within a given range.
- **Fibonacci Sequence** - Generate the Fibonacci sequence using a `for` loop.

The Java files are organized into subfolders based on the type of problems:

- **`basics/`**: Fundamental Java programs.
- **`loops/`**: Programs using different types of loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- **`patterns/`**: Programs for generating patterns (e.g., triangles, diamonds).
- **`arrays/`**: Programs that involve array manipulation and algorithms.
- **`recursion/`**: Recursive problem solutions.
- **`strings/`**: String manipulation and related challenges.
- **`leetcode/`**: Solutions to various problems from Leetcode.
- **`rough/`**: Rough or experimental problem-solving code.
