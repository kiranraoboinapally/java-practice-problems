### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kiranraoboinapally/java-web-dev-practice.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Program Directory**:

   Go to the directory that contains the program you want to run (Java, HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, Spring Boot, SQL).

3. **Compile and Run Java Programs**:
   
   To compile and run any Java program:
   
   ```bash
   javac programName.java    # Compile the program
   java programName          # Run the program
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   javac fizzBuzz.java
   java fizzBuzz
   ```

4. **Access SQL Concepts**:

   Open the `sql/ChatGPT.md` file to explore daily updated SQL concepts.

5. **Web Development**:
   
   - **HTML**: Practice building HTML pages and forms.
   - **CSS**: Learn styling techniques such as Flexbox and CSS Grid.
   - **JavaScript**: Solve problems involving DOM manipulation, events, and algorithms.
   - **ReactJS**: Build interactive applications using React, including handling state and props.

   Example:
   
   ```bash
   cd webdev/HTML
   open index.html   # Open HTML file in browser for testing
   ```

   For JavaScript and ReactJS, open the respective files or use tools like `npm` to run them in a local environment.

6. **Spring Boot**:

   For Spring Boot practice, go to the `springboot/` folder and follow the instructions to run Spring Boot applications. Use Maven or Gradle to build and run the application.

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run   # Run Spring Boot app with Maven
   ```
