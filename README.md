## Java Programs

The **Java Programs** section contains coding challenges to help you practice core Java concepts, such as loops, arrays, recursion, strings, and more.

Examples of included programs:

- **Swapping Numbers** - Swap two numbers using various methods.
- **FizzBuzz** - Print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
- **Prime Numbers in a Range** - Print prime numbers within a given range.
- **Fibonacci Sequence** - Generate the Fibonacci sequence using a `for` loop.

The Java files are organized into subfolders based on the type of problems:

- **`basics/`**: Fundamental Java programs.
- **`loops/`**: Programs using different types of loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- **`patterns/`**: Programs for generating patterns (e.g., triangles, diamonds).
- **`arrays/`**: Programs that involve array manipulation and algorithms.
- **`recursion/`**: Recursive problem solutions.
- **`strings/`**: String manipulation and related challenges.
- **`leetcode/`**: Solutions to various problems from Leetcode.
- **`rough/`**: Rough or experimental problem-solving code (Feel free to add new problems to experiment and explore here).
