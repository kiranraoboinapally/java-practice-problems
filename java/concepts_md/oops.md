### **Presentation: Essential OOP Concepts in Java**

In this presentation, we will cover the essential Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, which are fundamental to Java and frequently asked in technical interviews. We will focus on the core concepts that tech companies often inquire about, such as:

---

#### **Key Topics to be Covered:**

- **Access Modifiers**  
  - Examples: `private`, `public`, `default`, `protected`, `static`, `final`, `abstract`
  
- **Classes and Objects**
  
- **Methods and Constructors**
  
- **Polymorphism**  
  - Method Overloading  
  - Method Overriding
  
- **Encapsulation**
  
- **Abstraction**
  
- **Interfaces** and **Functional Interfaces**
  
- **Inheritance** and its types
  
- **Constructor Overloading**
  
- **The use of `this` and `super` keywords**

---

#### **Presentation Goal:**

The goal is to explain:
- **Where** and **how** to apply these concepts in practice.
- **When** to use each concept.
- The **key differences** between them.

Each topic will be explained from a basic to advanced level, ensuring a comprehensive understanding. By the end of this presentation, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to tackle both theoretical and practical questions in interviews and real-world programming scenarios.

### **What is a Class in Java?**

In Java, a **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. Essentially, a class organizes and structures the code.

---

#### **Key Points of a Class:**

- **Fields** (also called attributes or properties):  
  Variables that hold data or state for the class.
  
- **Methods**:  
  Functions or actions that define the behavior of the class.
  
- **Constructors**:  
  Special methods used to initialize objects of the class when they are created.

---

#### **Example of a Simple Class:**

```java
class Car {
    // Fields
    String make;
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("The engine is now running.");
    }
}
```

---

In this example:
- **`Car`** is a class with:
  - **Fields**: `make`, `model`, and `year`
  - **Constructor**: Used to initialize a new `Car` object with the given properties.
  - **Method**: `startEngine()` defines the behavior for the car object.

---

#### **Using the Class:**

To create an object (an instance) of the class and use its methods:

```java
Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);
myCar.startEngine();  // Output: The engine is now running.
```

### **Conclusion**

In summary, a **class** is a central concept in Java that helps structure your code by grouping related fields and methods. This makes your code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.
