In this presentation, we will cover the essential Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including key topics and definitions that are frequently asked in interviews. We will focus on the core concepts that tech companies often inquire about, such as:

- **Access Modifiers** (e.g., private, public, default, protected, static, final, abstract)
- **Classes and Objects**
- **Methods and Constructors**
- **Polymorphism** (Method Overloading, Method Overriding)
- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction**
- **Interfaces** and **Functional Interfaces**
- **Inheritance** and its types
- **Constructor Overloading**
- **The use of `this` and `super` keywords**

The goal is to explain **where** and **how** to apply these concepts in practice, **when** to use each one, and the key differences between them. Each topic will be explored from a basic to advanced level, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the concepts and their applications in Java. This will equip you with the knowledge to tackle both theoretical and practical questions in interviews and real-world scenarios.
